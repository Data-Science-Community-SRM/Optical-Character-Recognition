             ### Image --> Text Conversion
             Optical character recognition (OCR) is the conversion of images to text.
             In order to extract and repurpose data from scanned documents, camera images or PDFs, you need an OCR software that would single out letters on the image thus enabling you to access and edit the original document.

             ### Step 1. Reading the Image
             For converting an image into text, we have to do a task nobody would have ever thought of: Read the Image. We have done this using a predefined function in Streamlit.
             
             ### Step 2. Image preprocessing
             For this step, we have to use a library specifically made for such a project- Tesseract. Tesseract is an OCR engine with support for unicode and the ability to recognize more than 100 languages out of the box.
             In this we have to alter the image in such a way that it would get the most accurate results.
             Tesseract is finding templates in pixels, letters, words and sentences. It uses a two-step approach that calls adaptive recognition.
             It requires one data stage for character recognition, then the second stage to fulfil any letters, it wasnâ€™t insured in, by letters that can match the word or sentence context.
             #### The better the image quality (size, contrast, lightning) the better the recognition result.

    st.write("""
             ### Step 3. Text Recognition 
             Before the text recognition, via the image preprocessing, we must ensure that: \n
                 1. It is a binary image
                 2. Size of the image is not too big
                 3. Area of interest is highlighted
                 4. Noise is removed (All unnecessary background data)
                 5. The typography is common (so that it is easier to read) \n
            #### After all these conditions are met, we can convert the image to text with high accuracy.

             The final stage of the conversion is testing, which means that the project is tested on several datasets to check its accuracy. A few tweaks are made at the end and the project is retested.
